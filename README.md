# PLC61131Repos
A bunch of PLC projects are collected in this repository.


## BZ172Lab
This project is built based on Eliwell TM172PGD42R PLC which is from Schneider-electric Modicon product family. The main purpose of this project is to explore the feasibilities of applying some common software design skills and patterns with IEC-61131-3 programming methods such as structural text language. 'BZoops' is chosen for evaluation because there is a similar project designed by ANSI C and a comparison to this would give better understanding of why OOP design is necessary for software design.
